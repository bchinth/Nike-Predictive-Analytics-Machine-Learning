Executive Summary
In the face of intense competition within the athletic footwear industry, our project embarks on a groundbreaking journey to harness the power of advanced data analytics. This initiative is propelled by the necessity to transcend traditional market research and brand positioning strategies, which have been the cornerstone of Nike's approach to understanding and engaging its diverse consumer base. Business Questions:
Our analysis is structured around critical business questions aimed at deepening our understanding of Nike's market positioning and consumer engagement. These include:
1. Product Range Themes: What are the prevalent topics or themes across Nike's product range, and how do they influence customer choice?
2. Description Variation: How do product descriptions vary across different categories, and what does this imply about Nike’s marketing focus?
3. Premium Product Differentiation: Which topics are most associated with Nike's premium products, and how are these items differentiated in descriptions?
Data Source:
The backbone of our analysis is a comprehensive dataset meticulously compiled through web scraping techniques from Nike’s official website in our DDR Project.
Solution:

Our project employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for discovering themes in product descriptions and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for classifying texts, marking a shift towards leveraging data insights. The LDA model reveals key marketing language and features in Nike's products, while the LSTM network efficiently categorizes products based on this textual information. This combination of machine learning techniques provides fresh perspectives on Nike’s product strategy and customer engagement.

By integrating these findings into Nike's strategy, we aim to improve product development, refine marketing messages, and increase consumer satisfaction.
